# VideoAskRAG

A RAG system that can answer questions about a YouTube video. The system receives a YouTube video link and creates a transcription, which is used as context for any question that the user may ask. It is built with Llama 3.2 via Ollama, LangChain, and youtube-transcription-api, and hosted using Streamlit.
